# SOC-Playbooks
Description:
Developed a comprehensive SOC playbook to provide structured guidance for security teams across a wide range of cyber threats, including ransomware, phishing, insider threats, and DDoS attacks. The playbook is designed to support every stage of incident management, from detection to post-incident review, while emphasizing practical, human-focused procedures that maintain business continuity and minimize operational disruption.

Key highlights:

Defined Objectives and Scope: Established clear goals for the playbook to streamline incident response, ensure regulatory compliance, and align with organizational priorities. Defined the environments it covers, including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid systems.

Threat Identification and Categorization: Compiled a thorough inventory of potential threats, classified by attack vector, impact, and likelihood, enabling SOC teams to prioritize responses effectively.

Incident Response Procedures: Outlined detailed steps for detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents. Included guidelines for validating alerts, reducing false positives, and ensuring a structured post-incident review process.

Role Assignment and Escalation: Clearly defined responsibilities, decision-making authority, and escalation paths, including contingency planning for backup personnel to maintain seamless operations during critical incidents.

Integration with Existing Processes: Ensured the playbook aligns with organizational security policies, compliance requirements, business continuity plans, and cross-functional coordination with IT, legal, HR, and executive teams.

Visualization of Processes: Developed intuitive flowcharts and diagrams to illustrate incident lifecycles, making it easier for SOC teams to follow and implement procedures in real time.

This project demonstrates hands-on expertise in developing actionable SOC playbooks, translating cybersecurity theory into practical workflows, and preparing organizations to respond effectively to a wide range of cyber threats.
